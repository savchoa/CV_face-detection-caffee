# Description of the project

In this project, using OpenCV Python and a pre-trained neural network from the zoo of Cafee models, I solved the problem of face detection in the image (image_face_detection_caffe.ipynb), as well as in the video stream from the webcam (script web_face-detection-caffee.py). The result can be seen in .ipynb and web_face_detection_caffee.avi.
